# TO DO or to do nothing
Again, that's not a question, dear Shakespeare.

Anyhow, a list of things that could be done, might get done.

- BUG: Open Solution, if installed in several projects that are both open together, will essentially queue up the excess "open solution" requests. At least the behaviour with Rider is such that if I close Rider, it will re-open because that's when Windows processes the "open solution" request of the other project.
