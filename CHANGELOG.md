# Change Log

#### v0.1.1 - Jan 05, 2023

- Tryfix: use a different code path to open solution to avoid re-opening the IDE when 2+ Unity projects with that feature had been opened together.
- Made the "open solution" class static and internal so it doesn't pollute the namespace

#### v0.1.0 - Dec 05, 2023

- "Open Solution" feature that opens the associated IDE when the project launches.
